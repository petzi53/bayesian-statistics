Bayesâ€™ Theorem: |
  This is the theorem that gives Bayesian data analysis its name. But the theorem itself is a trivial implication of probability theory. The mathematical definition of the posterior distribution arises from Bayes' Theorem. The key lesson is that the posterior is proportional to the product of the prior and the probability of the data.
