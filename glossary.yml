Bayesâ€™ Theorem: |
  This is the theorem that gives Bayesian data analysis its name. But the theorem itself is a trivial implication of probability theory. The mathematical definition of the posterior distribution arises from Bayes' Theorem. The key lesson is that the posterior is proportional to the product of the prior and the probability of the data. (SR2, Chap.2)
Contour Plot: |
  Contour plots are a way to show a three-dimensional surface on a two-dimensional plane. A contour plot is appropriate if you want to see how some value Z changes as a function of two inputs, X and Y: `z = f(x, y)`. Contour lines indicate levels that are the same.

Random Variables: |
  A statistical term for variables that associate different numeric values with each of the possible outcomes of some random process. By random here we do not mean the colloquial use of this term to mean something that is entirely unpredictable. A random process is simply a process whose outcome cannot be perfectly known ahead of time (it may nonetheless be quite predictable). (Chap.3)
Probabilities: |
  Probability is a mathematical tool used to study randomness. It deals with the chance of an event occurring. ([OpenStax: Statistics](https://openstax.org/books/statistics/pages/1-1-definitions-of-statistics-probability-and-key-terms)) In the discrete case, to calculate the probability that a random variable takes on any value within a range, we sum the individual probabilities corresponding to each of the values. We use Pr to explicitly state that the result is a probability from a discrete probability distribution, whereas p(value) is a probability density from a continuous probability distribution. (Chap.3)
Probability Density: |
  Probability density is a "density" function f(X). The density determines what the probabilities will be over a given range. The probability density function for a given value of random variable X represents the density of probability (probability per unit random variable) within a particular range of that random variable X. Probability densities can take values larger than 1. ([StackExchange Mathematics](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1464837/1215136)) We can use a continuous probability distribution to calculate the probability that a random variable lies within an interval of possible values. To do this, we use the continuous analogue of a sum, an integral. However, we recognise that calculating an integral is equivalent to calculating the area under a probability density curve. We use `p(value)` for probability densities and `Pr` for probabilities. (Chap.3)
Probability Distribution: |
  The two defining features are: (1) All values of the distribution must be real and non-negative. (2) The sum (for discrete random variables) or integral (for continuous random variables) across all possible values of the random variable must be 1. (Chap.3)
